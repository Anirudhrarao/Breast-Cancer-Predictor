# Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is a popular classification algorithm used to predict the probability of a categorical dependent variable. It is widely used in various domains, including medical diagnosis.

The key point in Simple Linear Regression is that the dependent variable must be a continuous/real value. However, the independent variable can be measured on continuous or categorical values.
